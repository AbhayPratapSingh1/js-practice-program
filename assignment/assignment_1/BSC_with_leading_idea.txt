split the problem in different parts:
1. Convert no into the binary string (with 0 rep as 2 and 1 rep as 3)
2. Convert substring into a no
3. Convert substring no into binary (with 0 rep as 2 and 1 rep as 3)
4. Adding zeros (2) in the main no as leading zeros according to the lenght of substring
5. compare the main no and substring no which is converted into the binary.
